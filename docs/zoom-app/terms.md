Terms of Service – dlzoom

Effective date: 2025‑01‑01

Please read these terms before using dlzoom. By using the tool, you agree to them.

What dlzoom does
- dlzoom helps you list and download your own Zoom Cloud Recordings. It can also connect through a hosted sign‑in service, or one you host yourself.
 - dlzoom is open‑source and free, and it will stay that way. We never sell any data.

Using dlzoom
- Only use dlzoom with accounts and recordings you are allowed to access.
- Follow Zoom’s terms and your organization’s policies.
- Keep your computer secure. If you host your own sign‑in service, keep that secure too.

Use at your own risk
- dlzoom is community software. It may have bugs or limitations and is not designed for mission‑critical use. You are solely responsible for how you use it and for any outcomes.

Things you shouldn’t do
- Don’t use dlzoom to access recordings that aren’t yours or that you don’t have permission to download.
- Don’t try to bypass Zoom’s security or misuse the service.

Third‑party services
- dlzoom works with Zoom. If you use our hosted sign‑in or host your own, that service also applies. Those services have their own terms and privacy policies.

No warranties
- dlzoom is provided “as is,” without any guarantees. You use it at your own risk.

Limitation of liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, revenue, or profits, arising from or related to your use of dlzoom, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

No professional advice
- dlzoom and its documentation do not provide legal, compliance, or professional advice. You should consult your own advisors for your specific situation.

Ending your use
- You can stop using dlzoom at any time and remove access in Zoom (App Marketplace → Manage → Added Apps → Remove). We can change or stop the project at any time.

Changes to these terms
- If these terms change, we’ll update the date above and the project history.

Contact
- Questions? Open a GitHub issue or email yaniv+dlzoom@golan.name.

Optional permissions (advanced)
- `meeting:read` (user-managed): enables definitive recurring-meeting marking in the recordings listing.
- `user:read` (user-managed): enables showing your name/email in `dlzoom whoami` for user tokens.
- These are optional and not required for core functionality.

Open source
- dlzoom is open source at https://github.com/yaniv-golan/dlzoom and is also governed by the project’s open‑source license (see LICENSE in the repository). If these Terms conflict with the open‑source license, the license governs your rights to the code.
